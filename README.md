# Prediction-of-proteins-structure
We use a quantum algorithm called Grover's algorithm, which allows us to determine the native conformation of the protein (the conformation of the protein that has minimal energy).
To achieve this, we will apply the following steps:
1- Preparing a Uniform Superposition State
2- Calculating Coordinates
3- Finding Energy Values
4- Identifying the conformation with minimal energy by applying the oracle operator and the diffusion function.
